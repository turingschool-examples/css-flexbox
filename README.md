Apply `display: flex` to the parent container.  `.wrapper`

Then, apply different versions of the following styles to the parent to see how the children get aligned:  


```css
* flex-direction: (choose one below)   
                 row;   
                 column;   

* justify-content: (choose one below)  
                    center;  
                    space-around;  
                    space-between;  
                    space-evenly;  
                    flex-end;   

* align-items: (choose one below)  
                stretch;  
                flex-start;  
                flex-end;  
                center;  
                baseline;
