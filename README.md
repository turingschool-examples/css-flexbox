## Use the browser's dev tools to apply flexbox

Apply `display: flex` to the parent container.  `.wrapper`

Then, use the browser's dev tools to apply different versions of the following styles to the parent to see how the children get aligned:  

Tips for using the Dev Tools:
- Find or type the style declaration in the 'styles' section of the dev tools.  Ex.  `justify-content: center`
- Double click the value of the style. Then hit delete. Ex. Double click `center` then hit the delete key.
- Your cursor will remain there, ready to type in whatever value.  A popup box will show with all the value options for that style.  You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll and see each option being applied.
